## Recall our last class

We created a market for extra credit.

. . .

The outcome was **efficient**—we exhausted all gains from trade.

. . .

But was it **fair**?

---

## A question of endowments

Some of you happened to be given an extra credit point.

. . .

Some of you didn't.

. . .

Even though the market outcome maximized total surplus, *who* benefited depended entirely on those initial endowments.

---

## The fundamental distinction

> **Efficiency** asks: How big is the pie?

. . .

> **Equity** asks: How is the pie divided?

. . .

Failure to separate these is probably one of the biggest conceptual mistakes in policy today.

---

## Today's roadmap

1. Trends in inequality
2. What "fairness" means
3. Ideal redistribution (and why it's impossible)
4. The costs of real-world redistribution
5. When distortions are actually good

# Key Concepts {background-color="#800000"}

---

## Efficiency

> Whether the economy is set up to generate the maximum *total* benefits

. . .

Efficiency is about the **size** of the pie.

. . .

An efficient allocation leaves no gains from trade unexploited.

---

## Equity

> Whether the *distribution* of benefits is judged to be fair

. . .

Equity is about how the pie is **divided**.

. . .

Note: This is a normative judgment—outside economics per se.

---

## Distortions

> When policy drives a wedge between social value and private return

. . .

Distortions cause people to make decisions that don't maximize total surplus.

. . .

They're usually the *cost* of achieving a more equitable distribution.

---

## Deadweight loss

> The loss in total benefits that results from distortions

. . .

When we redistribute, the pie often shrinks.

. . .

Deadweight loss measures **how much** it shrinks.

---

## Second best

> The lowest-cost way to achieve a particular distribution

. . .

If we can't achieve equity for free, what's the most efficient way to get there?

# Inequality 101 {background-color="#800000"}

Where do we stand?

---

## US income inequality: The headline

![](images/us-inequality-trend.svg){fig-align="center" width="85%"}

::: {.notes}
Source: World Inequality Database. Shows share of national income going to top 10% vs bottom 50%.
:::

---

## What happened?

From ~1980 onward:

- Top 10% share rose from ~35% to ~45%
- Bottom 50% share fell from ~20% to ~13%

. . .

The gains from economic growth went disproportionately to the top.

---

## Another perspective: Top 1%

The top 1% now earns about **20%** of all income.

. . .

In the 1970s, it was closer to 10%.

. . .

> The very top has pulled away even from the rest of the top 10%.

---

## Wealth inequality is even starker

**Income**: What you earn each year

**Wealth**: What you own (assets minus debts)

. . .

The top 1% owns roughly **30%** of all wealth.

. . .

The bottom 50% owns about **2%**.

---

## A global perspective

---

## The elephant curve

Over the past 40 years, who gained the most globally?

. . .

1. The global middle class (especially China, India)
2. The global top 1%

. . .

Who gained the least?

. . .

> The working and middle classes in rich countries.

---

## Why does this matter?

Inequality affects:

- Political stability
- Social mobility
- Health outcomes
- Trust in institutions

. . .

But whether it's a *problem* depends on your values.

# What Is Fairness? {background-color="#800000"}

Different philosophical perspectives

---

## Let's find out what you think

I'm going to describe some scenarios.

. . .

For each one, tell me what the fair outcome is.

. . .

**[Poll: pollev.com/e4e]**

---

## Scenario 1: The shipwreck

You're on a lifeboat with 10 others. You have 100 units of food.

. . .

**Option A**: Everyone gets 10 units

**Option B**: The person who can ration best distributes it (total consumed: 120 equivalent units due to efficiency)

**Option C**: Whoever grabbed it first keeps it

. . .

**What's fair?**

---

## Scenario 2: The inheritance

A wealthy person dies. Should their children:

. . .

**A**: Inherit everything (property rights)

**B**: Inherit nothing—it goes to charity (equal opportunity)

**C**: Inherit some, with the rest taxed (compromise)

. . .

**What's fair?**

---

## Scenario 3: The kidney

One kidney is available. Three patients need it:

. . .

**A**: A 25-year-old who will live 40 more years

**B**: A 65-year-old who invented a life-saving drug

**C**: Whoever has waited longest on the list

. . .

**What's fair?**

---

## The point

There's no consensus on what "fair" means.

. . .

Different frameworks give different answers.

. . .

Let's look at the main ones.

---

## Utilitarianism

> Maximize total well-being across all people.

. . .

**Implication**: Transfer resources until marginal utility is equalized.

. . .

If a dollar means more to a poor person than a rich person, transfer it.

. . .

**Problem**: Doesn't care about distribution per se—only totals.

---

## Rawlsian maximin

> Maximize the well-being of the worst-off person.

. . .

John Rawls asked: What rules would you choose behind a "veil of ignorance"?

. . .

If you didn't know your place in society, you'd protect the bottom.

. . .

**Problem**: Ignores everyone except the very worst off.

---

## Libertarianism

> Respect property rights and voluntary exchange.

. . .

Whatever distribution emerges from fair processes is fair.

. . .

**Problem**: Ignores how initial endowments were acquired.

---

## Equality of opportunity

> Everyone should have the same starting point.

. . .

Inequality of outcomes is okay if it results from fair competition.

. . .

**Problem**: Hard to define and achieve equal starting points.

---

## Equality of outcomes

> Everyone should end up with the same amount.

. . .

**Problem**: Eliminates incentives; practically impossible.

---

## Where do you stand?

**[Poll: Which framework resonates most with you?]**

. . .

- Utilitarian (maximize total well-being)
- Rawlsian (protect the worst off)
- Libertarian (respect property rights)
- Equal opportunity
- Equal outcomes

---

## The economist's role

Economics can't tell you which framework is "right."

. . .

That's a normative judgment—a question of values.

. . .

But economics *can* tell you:

> What are the **costs** of achieving different distributions?

# Ideal Redistribution {background-color="#800000"}

The Second Welfare Theorem

---

## A remarkable result

Suppose the market allocation differs from your preferred "fair" outcome.

. . .

Can we get to the fair outcome without losing efficiency?

. . .

**Yes—in theory.**

---

## The Second Welfare Theorem

> Any efficient allocation can be achieved by:
>
> 1. Redistributing initial endowments
> 2. Then letting the market work

. . .

If we could just reshuffle who starts with what, markets would do the rest.

---

## Back to our classroom market

Imagine I wanted to help students who most need the extra credit.

. . .

**Ideal solution**: Give the initial extra credit points to *them* instead.

. . .

Then let the market play out normally.

. . .

Efficient *and* equitable!

---

## The catch

This requires **lump-sum** taxes and transfers.

. . .

**Lump-sum** means:

- Pre-specified amounts
- Do *not* depend on your behavior or choices

. . .

Like a fixed tax you pay regardless of what you do.

---

## Why lump-sum works

If a tax doesn't depend on your choices, it doesn't distort them.

. . .

You face the same incentives as before—you just start with less money.

. . .

> No deadweight loss. No distortion. Just redistribution.

---

## The problem

What could we actually tax in a lump-sum way?

. . .

We'd need to tax something **immutable**—that you can't change.

. . .

One serious proposal: **tax height**.

---

## Wait, really?

Mankiw & Weinzierl (2010) showed:

- Taller people earn more on average
- Height is (mostly) genetically determined
- A height tax would be non-distortionary

. . .

> "The case for taxing height is about as good as the case for taxing income."

. . .

Nobody actually proposes this. But it illustrates the problem.

---

## Why we can't do lump-sum

We can't observe the things we'd need to observe:

- Innate ability
- Effort capacity
- Future earnings potential

. . .

So we tax things we *can* observe: income, wealth, consumption.

. . .

But these depend on choices—so taxes distort behavior.

# The Cost of Redistribution {background-color="#800000"}

Why can't we just tax the rich?

---

## A simple idea

Rich people have a lot of money.

. . .

Poor people need money.

. . .

Why not just tax the rich and give to the poor?

---

## The behavioral response

We covered this in our lecture on incentives.

. . .

When you tax income, you change the return to working.

. . .

Higher taxes → work becomes less attractive → people work less.

---

## Recall the Laffer curve

![](images/laffer-curve.svg){fig-align="center" width="70%"}

At some point, raising rates actually *lowers* revenue.

---

## The real cost

Even before we hit the peak, higher taxes cause:

- Reduced labor supply
- Less entrepreneurship
- More tax avoidance

. . .

The tax base shrinks—so the pie gets smaller.

---

## The tradeoff

> We can make the distribution more equal...
>
> ...but often at the cost of a smaller pie.

. . .

This is the fundamental **equity-efficiency tradeoff**.

---

## How big is this cost?

Remember the elasticity of taxable income?

. . .

Best estimates suggest it's around **0.25**.

. . .

Not zero—but not enormous either.

. . .

> We *can* redistribute, but there's a cost.

---

## An illustration with our workers

Let's go back to our construction workers and content creators.

. . .

Suppose society decides it's unfair that TikTokers might earn more than construction workers.

. . .

**Policy**: Tax TikTok earnings and subsidize construction wages.

---

## What happens?

The tax drives a **wedge** between what consumers pay and what creators receive.

. . .

Some content creators switch to construction work.

. . .

But wait—these are people whose comparative advantage is in TikToks!

---

## The distortion visualized

![](images/distortion-diagram.svg){fig-align="center" width="75%"}

---

## The math

Before the tax:
$$P_H \cdot H_0 + P_T \cdot T_0 = \text{Total Value}$$

. . .

After the tax, people reallocate. But:
$$P_H \cdot H_1 + P_T \cdot T_1 < P_H \cdot H_0 + P_T \cdot T_0$$

. . .

> Total value produced has fallen—even though we collected tax revenue.

---

## Why the loss?

We've shifted production to people who are relatively bad at it.

. . .

Content creators forced into construction produce fewer houses than real construction workers would.

. . .

Construction workers staying put don't make up the difference.

. . .

> **Deadweight loss**: The economy produces less than it could.

---

## What if we used lump-sum transfers?

Suppose we could tax content creators a fixed amount—regardless of whether they work in TikTok or construction.

. . .

Then the tax doesn't affect their work decisions.

. . .

No reallocation. No distortion. No deadweight loss.

. . .

But we can't observe "being a content creator" independent of their choices.

# Can Distortions Be Good? {background-color="#800000"}

Yes—when correcting externalities

---

## Recall externalities

An **externality** is when your action affects others who aren't part of the transaction.

. . .

- **Negative**: Pollution, congestion, secondhand smoke
- **Positive**: Vaccination, education

---

## The problem with externalities

Without intervention, markets produce:

- Too much of goods with negative externalities
- Too little of goods with positive externalities

. . .

Prices don't reflect the true social costs and benefits.

---

## The Pigouvian solution

**Arthur Pigou's insight**: Tax negative externalities, subsidize positive ones.

. . .

A tax equal to the external cost makes people **internalize** the harm.

. . .

> A distortion that *corrects* a market failure can increase efficiency.

---

## Carbon tax example

Burning fossil fuels causes climate change.

. . .

A carbon tax makes polluters pay for this harm.

. . .

**Result**: Less pollution, *and* higher total surplus.

. . .

> This is a "good" distortion—it fixes a broken price signal.

---

## The key insight

Distortions are costly when they push us *away* from efficiency.

. . .

But when markets are already failing, the right distortion can push us *toward* efficiency.

# Are Distortions Necessary? {background-color="#800000"}

Sometimes we need revenue

---

## Public goods

Some goods can't be provided by markets:

- National defense
- Basic research
- Public health infrastructure

. . .

These require **tax revenue** to provide.

---

## The necessity of taxes

If we need taxes to fund public goods, we'll have some distortion.

. . .

The goal isn't to eliminate distortion—it's to minimize it.

. . .

> Raise the revenue you need in the least costly way possible.

---

## Efficient taxation

Economic research suggests:

- **Broad bases, low rates** minimize distortion
- Tax things that are **hard to change** (land, consumption)
- Avoid taxing things that are **easy to move** (capital, mobile workers)

. . .

This is why economists often prefer consumption taxes to income taxes.

# Is There Always a Tradeoff? {background-color="#800000"}

---

## Sometimes we can do both

In rare cases, we can increase **both** efficiency and equity:

. . .

- Removing regulations that protect the wealthy (occupational licensing, zoning)
- Fixing market failures that hurt the poor (predatory lending, pollution in poor neighborhoods)
- Investing in human capital (education for disadvantaged kids)

. . .

These are win-wins—but they're not always available.

---

## The hard cases

Most of the time, we face real tradeoffs.

. . .

More redistribution → more distortion → smaller pie.

. . .

The question isn't whether to redistribute—it's *how much*.

. . .

> The answer depends on your values *and* the costs.

# Wrapping Up {background-color="#800000"}

---

## Key takeaways

1. **Efficiency and equity are distinct**—don't conflate size with distribution

. . .

2. **Fairness is normative**—economics can't tell you what's fair

. . .

3. **Ideal redistribution is impossible**—lump-sum taxes aren't feasible

. . .

4. **Real redistribution has costs**—distortions reduce total output

. . .

5. **Sometimes distortions help**—when correcting externalities

---

## Thinking like an economist

An economist holds **both** ideas in mind:

. . .

- Markets are powerful tools for efficiency
- Distribution matters and may require intervention

. . .

> The goal is to understand the tradeoffs and quantify them.

---

## Next time

We'll explore how economists actually **measure** the effects of policies.

. . .

How do we know if a policy worked?

. . .

The answer: **Causation and experiments**.
