## Today's Journey

Markets are one of the most powerful institutions humans have ever created.

. . .

Today we'll explore:

- Why markets are so good at delivering benefits
- How prices coordinate complex economic activity
- The gains from specialization
- When and why markets fail
- What we can do about those failures

## Key Ideas for Today

**Gains from trade**: The benefits buyers and sellers get from exchange

. . .

**Comparative advantage**: The returns to focusing on what you're *relatively* better at

. . .

**Markets as surplus maximizers**: Under ideal conditions, markets deliver maximum total benefits

. . .

**Market failures**: Forces that prevent markets from achieving their potential

A classroom experiment

## Our Very Own Market

I'm going to allocate half the class **one point of extra credit**.

. . .

You will be the **sellers** in this market.

. . .

The other half of the class will be the **buyers**.

## Your Task

**If you are a seller:**

> Report the *lowest* price (in dollars) at which you would give up your extra credit point.

. . .

**If you are a buyer:**

> Report the *highest* price (in dollars) at which you would buy an extra credit point.

. . .

Take a moment to reflect. What is that point really worth to you?

## Discussion

- Who wants to trade at the equilibrium price?

. . .

- Do the traders benefit? How much?

. . .

- What about the people who *didn't* trade?

. . .

- What role does the price play here?

# The First Welfare Theorem {background-color="#800000"}

Why markets maximize benefits

## Willingness to Pay and Accept

Consider a market for a single good (say, toasters).

. . .

**Sellers** each have a *willingness to accept* (WTA)

> The smallest amount they'd take to part with the good

. . .

**Buyers** each have a *willingness to pay* (WTP)

> The highest amount they'd pay to acquire the good

## Surplus: The Gains from Trade

When a buyer pays **less** than their WTP:

> They get **consumer surplus** = WTP - Price

. . .

When a seller receives **more** than their WTA:

> They get **producer surplus** = Price - WTA

. . .

**Total surplus** = Consumer surplus + Producer surplus

## What Happens at Equilibrium?

At the equilibrium price $p$:

. . .

- Every seller with WTA ≤ $p$ has sold
- Every buyer with WTP ≥ $p$ has bought

. . .

The only remaining sellers want *more* than $p$.

The only remaining buyers will pay *less* than $p$.

. . .

> **No more gains from trade exist!**

## The First Welfare Theorem

> Under certain conditions, competitive markets automatically maximize total surplus.

. . .

This is remarkable. No central planner needed.

. . .

Just people pursuing their own interests, guided by prices.

. . .

Adam Smith called this the "invisible hand."

## Prices as Signals

Here's something remarkable about the equilibrium price:

. . .

**For sellers**: The price reflects the *marginal cost* of production

> The cost of producing one more unit

. . .

**For buyers**: The price reflects the *marginal benefit* of consumption

> The value of consuming one more unit

. . .

At equilibrium: **Marginal cost = Marginal benefit = Price**

## Why This Matters

The price tells producers: "This is what society values an extra unit at."

. . .

The price tells consumers: "This is what it costs society to make an extra unit."

. . .

> **Prices coordinate decisions across millions of people who will never meet.**

. . .

No one needs to know the whole picture. The price contains the information.

# How Markets Find Prices {background-color="#800000"}

The discovery process

## Price Discovery in the Real World

Real markets are messy. Prices don't appear by magic.

. . .

**If price is too high:** Excess supply

- Sellers undercut each other to secure trades

. . .

**If price is too low:** Excess demand

- Buyers offer premiums to secure goods

. . .

Market pressures push toward equilibrium.

## Examples of Price Discovery

**Retail inventory management**

- Prices drop when shelves are full
- Prices rise when stock runs low

. . .

**Auctions**

- eBay, art markets, Treasury bonds
- Price emerges from competitive bidding

. . .

**Entry and exit**

- High profits → new firms enter → prices fall
- Losses → firms exit → prices rise

## A Deeper Point

You might think: supply and demand *determine* price.

. . .

But in practice, prices are *discovered* through experimentation.

. . .

In this sense: **prices determine supply and demand.**

. . .

Prices are *signals* that coordinate behavior.

## Case Study: Gold

What determines how much gold gets mined?

. . .

![](images/gold-cost-curve.svg){fig-align="center" width="70%"}

## Gold: When Demand Surges

When demand for gold increases:

. . .

1. Price rises

. . .

2. Mining operations that were unprofitable become profitable

. . .

3. Supply expands

. . .

> The price *signal* coordinated this response—no central planner required.

# Specialization and Prices {background-color="#800000"}

How do people decide what to produce?

## Two Types of Workers

Let's think about an economy with two types of workers:

. . .

**Construction workers** — skilled at building things

. . .

**Content creators** — skilled at making TikToks

. . .

Each worker can produce *either* good, but with different productivities.

## What Can Each Type Produce?

In one day:

. . .

**Construction worker** can build:

- **2 houses**, OR
- **1 TikTok**

. . .

**Content creator** can make:

- **0.5 houses**, OR
- **4 TikToks**

## Absolute Advantage

Who is better at what?

. . .

Construction workers are **4× better** at building houses (2 vs 0.5)

. . .

Content creators are **4× better** at making TikToks (4 vs 1)

. . .

Each type has **absolute advantage** in their natural specialty.

## The Production Possibilities Frontier

Recall from last time: a **PPF** shows the combinations of goods you can produce.

. . .

If you spend *all* your time on one good, you get the maximum of that good.

. . .

If you split your time, you get some of each.

## Construction Worker's PPF

![](images/cw-ppf.svg){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

## Why Is the PPF Curved?

The PPF bows *outward* from the origin.

. . .

This reflects **increasing opportunity cost**:

. . .

- The first hour on houses uses your best house-building skills
- Later hours use skills less suited to construction

. . .

As you make more of one good, each additional unit costs more of the other.

## Content Creator's PPF

![](images/cc-ppf.svg){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

## Same Shape, Different Scale

Both PPFs are curved outward.

. . .

But they differ in what each worker can produce at maximum.

. . .

**The question**: Where on their PPF should each worker produce?

# Enter Prices {background-color="#800000"}

How markets guide production decisions

## Market Prices

Suppose houses and TikToks trade in a market:

. . .

- **Houses**: $200 each
- **TikToks**: $50 each

. . .

Houses are worth **4× as much** as TikToks.

## What Should Workers Produce?

Each worker wants to **maximize their income**.

. . .

Should construction workers make houses or TikToks?

. . .

Should content creators make houses or TikToks?

. . .

Let's think about the tradeoffs.

## The Optimal Production Point

A worker should produce where the **opportunity cost** equals the **price ratio**.

. . .

> At the optimal point, the slope of the PPF equals the relative price.

. . .

This is where shifting production wouldn't increase income.

## Construction Worker's Choice

![](images/cw-ppf.svg){fig-align="center" width="70%"}

. . .

Mostly houses, but *some* TikToks — where PPF slope = price ratio.

## Why Not All Houses?

At the corner (all houses), making one more house costs very few TikToks.

. . .

But the market values houses at only 4 TikToks each.

. . .

> Better to make some TikToks where the tradeoff is favorable.

## Content Creator's Choice

![](images/cc-ppf.svg){fig-align="center" width="70%"}

. . .

Mostly TikToks, but *some* houses — where PPF slope = price ratio.

## The Pattern

Each worker:

- Focuses **mostly** on what they're good at
- Does **a little** of the other activity

. . .

The exact mix depends on where opportunity cost = price ratio.

## What If Prices Changed?

If TikToks became more valuable (say, $100 each):

. . .

- The price ratio would shift
- Both workers would make *more* TikToks
- Both optimal points would move along their PPFs

. . .

> **Prices tell workers where to produce.**

## The Magic of Prices

Workers don't need to know each other's abilities.

. . .

They don't need to coordinate with anyone.

. . .

They just respond to **prices** — and the economy specializes efficiently.

## The Invisible Hand

> Prices guide each person to their comparative advantage—automatically.

. . .

No central planner needed.

. . .

**Prices contain the information** needed to coordinate production across millions of people.

# When Markets Fail {background-color="#800000"}

The fine print on that welfare theorem

## Remember Those "Conditions"?

The First Welfare Theorem says markets maximize surplus...

. . .

...**under certain conditions.**

. . .

When these conditions fail, we get **market failures**.

. . .

Let's explore the three most important ones.

# Failure #1: Information Asymmetry {background-color="#800000"}

When some know more than others

## The Market for "Lemons"

Imagine you're buying a used car.

. . .

- Some used cars are great ("peaches")
- Some are terrible ("lemons")

. . .

**The seller knows which type they have. You don't.**

## What Happens?

You're willing to pay the *average* value.

. . .

But sellers of good cars won't accept that—it's below their car's worth.

. . .

So good cars exit the market.

. . .

Only lemons remain!

. . .

> **Adverse selection**: The market unravels because of information asymmetry.

::: {.notes}
Reference: Akerlof, G. (1970). "The Market for Lemons." Quarterly Journal of Economics.
:::

## Let's Play: Lemons Edition

Let's revisit our extra credit market.

. . .

Sellers: I'm going to randomly assign you to **real** or **fake** credits.

. . .

Check your email/phone now—I've sent half of you a message saying "REAL" and half "FAKE."

. . .

*(If you didn't get a message, your credit is FAKE.)*

## Lemons Game: The Rules

**Sellers**: You know if your credit is real (worth 1 point) or fake (worth 0).

. . .

**Buyers**: You *don't* know which sellers have real credits.

. . .

Sellers: What's your WTA now?

Buyers: What's your WTP now?

. . .

**Submit your answers!**

## Discussion: Lemons Game

- What happened to the market?
- Did good credits trade?
- How does this compare to used cars, health insurance, job markets?

## Real-World Responses

How do markets cope with information problems?

. . .

- **Warranties and guarantees**
- **Reputation systems** (Yelp, eBay ratings)
- **Certification** (inspections, credentials)
- **Regulation** (disclosure requirements)

# Failure #2: Externalities {background-color="#800000"}

When your choices affect others

## What's an Externality?

An **externality** is a cost or benefit that affects someone *not* involved in the transaction.

. . .

**Negative externality**: Your action harms others

> Factory pollution, secondhand smoke, loud music

. . .

**Positive externality**: Your action helps others

> Vaccinations, education, beautiful gardens

## Why Externalities Cause Failure

When you buy gas, you pay for:

- The cost of extracting and refining oil
- The gas station's markup

. . .

You *don't* pay for:

- Air pollution affecting your neighbors
- Climate change affecting everyone

. . .

> The market price is "wrong"—it doesn't reflect the true social cost.

## The Result

![](images/externality-diagram.svg){fig-align="center" width="70%"}

## Too Much of a Bad Thing

With negative externalities:

- Private cost < Social cost
- Market produces **too much** of the good
- Total surplus is *not* maximized

. . .

> Pollution is the classic example. The market "fails" because prices don't include all costs.

## Let's Play: Externalities Edition

Back to our credit market.

. . .

New rule: **Each credit point sold reduces the value of ALL other credits by 5%.**

. . .

If 5 trades happen, every credit (traded or not) is worth only 75% of a point.

. . .

This is like a curve: the more points out there, the less each one helps your grade.

## Externalities Game: Think About It

You're a buyer. You still want a credit point.

. . .

But when you buy one, you make *everyone else's* credits less valuable.

. . .

**Do you consider that cost when deciding to trade?**

. . .

**Should** that cost affect whether the trade happens?

## Discussion: Externality Game

- How many trades are privately beneficial?
- How many trades are *socially* beneficial (counting harm to others)?
- Who bears the cost of your trade?
- How might we fix this?

# Failure #3: Market Power {background-color="#800000"}

When someone controls the market

## Perfect Competition Assumption

The welfare theorem assumes **price-taking** behavior:

> No individual buyer or seller can affect the market price.

. . .

But what if one seller controls most of the supply?

## Monopoly Pricing

A monopolist can **set** the price.

. . .

They'll charge more than the competitive price.

. . .

Result:

- Some beneficial trades don't happen
- Total surplus decreases
- The monopolist captures more surplus, but overall pie shrinks

## Let's Play: Monopoly Edition

New game structure:

. . .

I'll sell all the credits to **one student** at the earlier market price.

. . .

That student becomes the **monopolist** and sells to everyone else.

. . .

**Monopolist**: What price will you charge?

## Discussion: Monopoly Game

- What price did the monopolist choose?
- How many trades happened compared to the competitive market?
- Who won? Who lost?

## Real-World Market Power

- **Tech giants**: Google, Apple, Amazon, Meta
- **Pharmaceuticals**: Patent-protected drugs
- **Utilities**: Natural monopolies (water, electricity)
- **Local markets**: The only hospital in a rural area

# Addressing Market Failures {background-color="#800000"}

What can be done?

## The Role of Government

When markets fail, government intervention *can* help:

. . .

**Information problems**:

- Disclosure requirements
- Consumer protection laws
- Professional licensing

. . .

**Externalities**:

- Taxes on harmful activities (carbon tax)
- Subsidies for beneficial activities (education)
- Regulation (emission standards)

## Government Responses (continued)

**Market power**:

- Antitrust enforcement
- Price regulation for utilities
- Promoting competition

. . .

> But government intervention has its own costs and can fail too. More on this later in the course.

## The Coase Theorem

Sometimes private bargaining can solve externalities.

. . .

**Coase's insight**: If property rights are clear and transaction costs are low, people negotiate to the efficient outcome.

::: {.notes}
Reference: Coase, R. (1960). "The Problem of Social Cost." Journal of Law and Economics.
:::

## Coase Example

Factory pollutes, harms nearby residents.

. . .

- If residents have right to clean air → factory pays them
- If factory has right to pollute → residents pay factory

. . .

Either way, they negotiate to the efficient level of pollution!

## When Coase Works (and Doesn't)

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Works well**:

- Few parties
- Harm is measurable
- Clear property rights
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Doesn't work**:

- Many parties (climate)
- Hard to measure harm
- High transaction costs

# Key Takeaways {background-color="#800000"}

## What We Learned Today

1. **Markets maximize surplus** by exhausting gains from trade

. . .

2. **Prices are signals** that coordinate without central planning

. . .

3. **Comparative advantage** makes specialization valuable

. . .

4. **Markets can fail**: info asymmetry, externalities, market power

. . .

5. **Failures can be addressed**: government, bargaining, institutions

## The Bottom Line

> A market is a wonderful thing.

. . .

Thinking like an economist means:

- Understanding when markets work their magic
- Recognizing when they don't
- Designing institutions to help them succeed
