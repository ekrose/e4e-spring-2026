## Today's Journey

Markets are one of the most powerful institutions humans have ever created.

. . .

Today we'll explore:

- Why markets are so good at delivering benefits
- How prices coordinate complex economic activity
- The gains from specialization
- When and why markets fail
- What we can do about those failures

## Key Ideas for Today

**Gains from trade**: The benefits buyers and sellers get from exchange

. . .

**Comparative advantage**: The returns to focusing on what you're *relatively* better at

. . .

**Markets as surplus maximizers**: Under ideal conditions, markets deliver maximum total benefits

. . .

**Market failures**: Forces that prevent markets from achieving their potential

# Let's Create a Market {background-color="#800000"}

A classroom experiment

## Our Very Own Market

I'm going to allocate half the class **one point of extra credit**.

. . .

You will be the **sellers** in this market.

. . .

The other half of the class will be the **buyers**.

## Your Task

**If you are a seller:**

> Report the *lowest* price (in dollars) at which you would give up your extra credit point.

. . .

**If you are a buyer:**

> Report the *highest* price (in dollars) at which you would buy an extra credit point.

. . .

Take a moment to reflect. What is that point really worth to you?

## Discussion

- Who wants to trade at the equilibrium price?

. . .

- Do the traders benefit? How much?

. . .

- What about the people who *didn't* trade?

. . .

- What role does the price play here?

# The First Welfare Theorem {background-color="#800000"}

Why markets maximize benefits

## Willingness to Pay and Accept

Consider a market for a single good (say, toasters).

. . .

**Sellers** each have a *willingness to accept* (WTA)

> The smallest amount they'd take to part with the good

. . .

**Buyers** each have a *willingness to pay* (WTP)

> The highest amount they'd pay to acquire the good

## Surplus: The Gains from Trade

When a buyer pays **less** than their WTP:

> They get **consumer surplus** = WTP - Price

. . .

When a seller receives **more** than their WTA:

> They get **producer surplus** = Price - WTA

. . .

**Total surplus** = Consumer surplus + Producer surplus

## What Happens at Equilibrium?

At the equilibrium price $p$:

. . .

- Every seller with WTA ≤ $p$ has sold
- Every buyer with WTP ≥ $p$ has bought

. . .

The only remaining sellers want *more* than $p$.

The only remaining buyers will pay *less* than $p$.

. . .

> **No more gains from trade exist!**

## The First Welfare Theorem

> Under certain conditions, competitive markets automatically maximize total surplus.

. . .

This is remarkable. No central planner needed.

. . .

Just people pursuing their own interests, guided by prices.

. . .

Adam Smith called this the "invisible hand."

## Prices as Signals

Here's something remarkable about the equilibrium price:

. . .

**For sellers**: The price reflects the *marginal cost* of production

> The cost of producing one more unit

. . .

**For buyers**: The price reflects the *marginal benefit* of consumption

> The value of consuming one more unit

. . .

At equilibrium: **Marginal cost = Marginal benefit = Price**

## Why This Matters

The price tells producers: "This is what society values an extra unit at."

. . .

The price tells consumers: "This is what it costs society to make an extra unit."

. . .

> **Prices coordinate decisions across millions of people who will never meet.**

. . .

No one needs to know the whole picture. The price contains the information.

# How Markets Find Prices {background-color="#800000"}

The discovery process

## Price Discovery in the Real World

Real markets are messy. Prices don't appear by magic.

. . .

**If price is too high:** Excess supply

- Sellers undercut each other to secure trades

. . .

**If price is too low:** Excess demand

- Buyers offer premiums to secure goods

. . .

Market pressures push toward equilibrium.

## Examples of Price Discovery

**Retail inventory management**

- Prices drop when shelves are full
- Prices rise when stock runs low

. . .

**Auctions**

- eBay, art markets, Treasury bonds
- Price emerges from competitive bidding

. . .

**Entry and exit**

- High profits → new firms enter → prices fall
- Losses → firms exit → prices rise

## A Deeper Point

You might think: supply and demand *determine* price.

. . .

But in practice, prices are *discovered* through experimentation.

. . .

In this sense: **prices determine supply and demand.**

. . .

Prices are *signals* that coordinate behavior.

## Case Study: Gold

What determines how much gold gets mined?

. . .

![](images/gold-cost-curve.svg){fig-align="center" width="70%"}

## Gold: When Demand Surges

When demand for gold increases:

. . .

1. Price rises

. . .

2. Mining operations that were unprofitable become profitable

. . .

3. Supply expands

. . .

> The price *signal* coordinated this response—no central planner required.

# Specialization and Comparative Advantage {background-color="#800000"}

Why we don't all make our own shoes

## Beyond Single Markets

Prices don't just coordinate *within* a market.

. . .

They coordinate *across* markets.

. . .

This unlocks the gains from **specialization** and **comparative advantage**.

## A Tale of Two Students

Meet **Alex** and **Jordan**. They're working on a group project that requires:

- Writing a 10-page report
- Building a website

. . .

Here's how long each task takes them:

| Task | Alex | Jordan |
|------|------|--------|
| Write report | 10 hours | 5 hours |
| Build website | 2 hours | 4 hours |

## Who's "Better"?

**Absolute advantage**: Who can do the task faster?

. . .

- Jordan is faster at writing (5 hrs vs 10 hrs)
- Alex is faster at coding (2 hrs vs 4 hrs)

. . .

Seems obvious: Jordan writes, Alex codes.

. . .

But what if there were *two* reports and *two* websites?

## The Surprising Math

**Without specialization** (each does one of each):

| | Alex | Jordan | Total |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| Report | 10 hrs | 5 hrs | |
| Website | 2 hrs | 4 hrs | |
| **Total** | 12 hrs | 9 hrs | **21 hrs** |

## With Specialization

What if Alex does *both* websites and Jordan does *both* reports?

. . .

| | Alex | Jordan | Total |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| Reports | 0 | 10 hrs | |
| Websites | 4 hrs | 0 | |
| **Total** | 4 hrs | 10 hrs | **14 hrs** |

. . .

> **7 hours saved!** Same output, less total work.

## But Wait—What If One Person Is Better at Everything?

New example: **Sam** and **Taylor**

| Task | Sam | Taylor |
|------|-----|--------|
| Write report | 2 hours | 6 hours |
| Build website | 1 hour | 4 hours |

. . .

Sam has **absolute advantage in both tasks**!

. . .

Should Sam just do everything?

## Let's Do the Math

Suppose we need 2 reports and 2 websites.

. . .

**If Sam does everything:**

- 2 reports × 2 hrs + 2 websites × 1 hr = **6 hours for Sam**
- Taylor does nothing

. . .

**If they split evenly** (1 each):

- Sam: 2 + 1 = 3 hrs
- Taylor: 6 + 4 = 10 hrs
- **Total: 13 hours**

## The Power of Comparative Advantage

What's each person's **opportunity cost** of a website?

. . .

**Sam**: 1 hr website = 0.5 reports given up

**Taylor**: 4 hr website = 4/6 = 0.67 reports given up

. . .

Sam has comparative advantage in websites (lower opportunity cost).

Taylor has comparative advantage in... reports!

## Specialization Wins Again

**Taylor does 2 reports, Sam does 2 websites:**

- Sam: 2 websites × 1 hr = **2 hours**
- Taylor: 2 reports × 6 hrs = **12 hours**
- Total: **14 hours**

. . .

But wait—Sam had 4 hours of free time. What if Sam helps with reports?

. . .

**Sam does 2 websites + 1 report, Taylor does 1 report:**

- Sam: 2 + 2 = **4 hours**
- Taylor: **6 hours**
- Total: **10 hours** (vs 13 without specialization)

## Comparative Advantage: The Key Insight

> Even if someone is better at *everything*, there are still gains from specialization based on *comparative* advantage.

. . .

The person with absolute advantage in everything should focus on what they're *relatively* best at.

. . .

This is why countries trade. This is why you don't grow your own food.

## How Do People Know What to Specialize In?

In our examples, we calculated opportunity costs.

. . .

In real life, nobody does this math. So how does it work?

. . .

**Prices tell you.**

## Prices Coordinate Specialization

Suppose there's a market for coding and writing work:

| Task | Market Price |
|------|--------------|
| Write 1 report | $100 |
| Build 1 website | $150 |

. . .

What should Sam do? What should Taylor do?

## Calculating Returns

**Sam's hourly earnings:**

- Writing: $100 / 2 hrs = **$50/hr**
- Coding: $150 / 1 hr = **$150/hr**

. . .

**Taylor's hourly earnings:**

- Writing: $100 / 6 hrs = **$17/hr**
- Coding: $150 / 4 hrs = **$38/hr**

. . .

Sam should code. Taylor should... also code?

## The Market Adjusts

If everyone wants to code, what happens?

. . .

- Supply of coding ↑ → coding prices ↓
- Supply of writing ↓ → writing prices ↑

. . .

Prices adjust until it's worthwhile for *someone* to write.

. . .

> **Relative prices** guide each person to their comparative advantage—automatically.

## The Magic

No one needs to know everyone's abilities.

. . .

No one needs to calculate opportunity costs.

. . .

**Prices contain the information** needed to coordinate specialization across millions of people.

. . .

> This is the "invisible hand" at work.

# When Markets Fail {background-color="#800000"}

The fine print on that welfare theorem

## Remember Those "Conditions"?

The First Welfare Theorem says markets maximize surplus...

. . .

...**under certain conditions.**

. . .

When these conditions fail, we get **market failures**.

. . .

Let's explore the three most important ones.

# Failure #1: Information Asymmetry {background-color="#800000"}

When some know more than others

## The Market for "Lemons"

Imagine you're buying a used car.

. . .

- Some used cars are great ("peaches")
- Some are terrible ("lemons")

. . .

**The seller knows which type they have. You don't.**

## What Happens?

You're willing to pay the *average* value.

. . .

But sellers of good cars won't accept that—it's below their car's worth.

. . .

So good cars exit the market.

. . .

Only lemons remain!

. . .

> **Adverse selection**: The market unravels because of information asymmetry.

## Let's Play: Lemons Edition

Let's revisit our extra credit market.

. . .

Sellers: I'm going to randomly assign you to **real** or **fake** credits.

. . .

Check your email/phone now—I've sent half of you a message saying "REAL" and half "FAKE."

. . .

*(If you didn't get a message, your credit is FAKE.)*

## Lemons Game: The Rules

**Sellers**: You know if your credit is real (worth 1 point) or fake (worth 0).

. . .

**Buyers**: You *don't* know which sellers have real credits.

. . .

Sellers: What's your WTA now?

Buyers: What's your WTP now?

. . .

**Submit your answers!**

## Discussion: Lemons Game

- What happened to the market?
- Did good credits trade?
- How does this compare to used cars, health insurance, job markets?

## Real-World Responses

How do markets cope with information problems?

. . .

- **Warranties and guarantees**
- **Reputation systems** (Yelp, eBay ratings)
- **Certification** (inspections, credentials)
- **Regulation** (disclosure requirements)

# Failure #2: Externalities {background-color="#800000"}

When your choices affect others

## What's an Externality?

An **externality** is a cost or benefit that affects someone *not* involved in the transaction.

. . .

**Negative externality**: Your action harms others

> Factory pollution, secondhand smoke, loud music

. . .

**Positive externality**: Your action helps others

> Vaccinations, education, beautiful gardens

## Why Externalities Cause Failure

When you buy gas, you pay for:

- The cost of extracting and refining oil
- The gas station's markup

. . .

You *don't* pay for:

- Air pollution affecting your neighbors
- Climate change affecting everyone

. . .

> The market price is "wrong"—it doesn't reflect the true social cost.

## The Result

![](images/externality-diagram.svg){fig-align="center" width="70%"}

## Too Much of a Bad Thing

With negative externalities:

- Private cost < Social cost
- Market produces **too much** of the good
- Total surplus is *not* maximized

. . .

> Pollution is the classic example. The market "fails" because prices don't include all costs.

## Let's Play: Externalities Edition

Back to our credit market.

. . .

New rule: **Each credit point sold reduces the value of ALL other credits by 5%.**

. . .

If 5 trades happen, every credit (traded or not) is worth only 75% of a point.

. . .

This is like a curve: the more points out there, the less each one helps your grade.

## Externalities Game: Think About It

You're a buyer. You still want a credit point.

. . .

But when you buy one, you make *everyone else's* credits less valuable.

. . .

**Do you consider that cost when deciding to trade?**

. . .

**Should** that cost affect whether the trade happens?

## Discussion: Externality Game

- How many trades are privately beneficial?
- How many trades are *socially* beneficial (counting harm to others)?
- Who bears the cost of your trade?
- How might we fix this?

# Failure #3: Market Power {background-color="#800000"}

When someone controls the market

## Perfect Competition Assumption

The welfare theorem assumes **price-taking** behavior:

> No individual buyer or seller can affect the market price.

. . .

But what if one seller controls most of the supply?

## Monopoly Pricing

A monopolist can **set** the price.

. . .

They'll charge more than the competitive price.

. . .

Result:

- Some beneficial trades don't happen
- Total surplus decreases
- The monopolist captures more surplus, but overall pie shrinks

## Let's Play: Monopoly Edition

New game structure:

. . .

I'll sell all the credits to **one student** at the earlier market price.

. . .

That student becomes the **monopolist** and sells to everyone else.

. . .

**Monopolist**: What price will you charge?

## Discussion: Monopoly Game

- What price did the monopolist choose?
- How many trades happened compared to the competitive market?
- Who won? Who lost?

## Real-World Market Power

- **Tech giants**: Google, Apple, Amazon, Meta
- **Pharmaceuticals**: Patent-protected drugs
- **Utilities**: Natural monopolies (water, electricity)
- **Local markets**: The only hospital in a rural area

# Addressing Market Failures {background-color="#800000"}

What can be done?

## The Role of Government

When markets fail, government intervention *can* help:

. . .

**Information problems**:

- Disclosure requirements
- Consumer protection laws
- Professional licensing

. . .

**Externalities**:

- Taxes on harmful activities (carbon tax)
- Subsidies for beneficial activities (education)
- Regulation (emission standards)

## Government Responses (continued)

**Market power**:

- Antitrust enforcement
- Price regulation for utilities
- Promoting competition

. . .

> But government intervention has its own costs and can fail too. More on this later in the course.

## The Coase Theorem

Sometimes markets can solve their own failures.

. . .

**Coase's insight**: If property rights are clear and transaction costs are low, private bargaining can achieve efficiency.

. . .

*Example*: Factory pollutes, affects nearby residents.

- If residents have right to clean air → factory pays them to allow pollution
- If factory has right to pollute → residents pay factory to reduce

. . .

Either way, they negotiate to the efficient outcome!

::: {.notes}
Reference: Coase, R. (1960). "The Problem of Social Cost." Journal of Law and Economics.
:::

## When Coase Works (and Doesn't)

**Works well**:

- Small number of parties
- Easy to measure the harm
- Clear property rights

. . .

**Doesn't work**:

- Many affected parties (climate change)
- Hard to identify who's harmed
- High transaction costs

# Key Takeaways {background-color="#800000"}

## What We Learned Today

1. **Markets are powerful**: They maximize total surplus by exhausting gains from trade

. . .

2. **Prices are signals**: They coordinate complex activity without central planning

. . .

3. **Specialization creates value**: Comparative advantage means everyone benefits from trade

. . .

4. **Markets can fail**: Information asymmetry, externalities, and market power

. . .

5. **Failures can be addressed**: Government intervention, private bargaining, institutional design

## The Bottom Line

> A market is a wonderful thing.

. . .

Thinking like an economist means:

- Understanding when markets work their magic
- Recognizing when they don't
- Designing institutions to help them succeed

## Next Time

**Equity vs. Efficiency**

- Is maximizing surplus enough?
- What about fairness?
- The fundamental tradeoffs in economic policy
