## Why incentives matter

- Policies change behavior  
- Behavior determines outcomes  
- Good intentions are not enough

## What is an incentive?

- Anything that changes costs or benefits
- Can be explicit or implicit
- Often unintended

## Goodhart’s Law

> When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.

- Metrics shape behavior
- Optimizing the metric ≠ optimizing the objective

- Responses occur on margins
- Outcomes may reverse
