## Recall our first principle

> **Economists believe that people optimize.**

. . .

Optimization means people do their best given:

- Their preferences
- The constraints they face

. . .

Optimization also means people respond to **incentives**.

---

## What is an incentive?

An incentive is anything that affects the **payoffs** of your choices.

. . .

**Monetary incentives:**

- Wages, prices, taxes, fines

. . .

**Non-monetary incentives:**

- Norms, reputation, emotions
- Convenience, effort, time
- Identity, social approval

---

## Why incentives matter for policy

When you change incentives, people respond.

. . .

The impact of a policy change will almost always:

- **Not** be as if the world stood still
- **Not** be exactly what you predict

. . .

If you're not careful, a policy might have the **opposite** effect of what you intended.

---

## Key ideas for today

. . .

**Behavioral response:** Adjustments people make when incentives change

. . .

**Strategic interactions:** How others' choices affect my incentives

. . .

**Unintended consequences:** When policies backfire due to unforeseen responses

. . .

**Cognitive biases:** Systematic departures from simple optimization

---

## Thinking like an economist

Thinking like an economist means:

1. **Predicting** behavioral responses before policy
2. **Measuring** responses after policy
3. **Designing** better incentives based on what you learn

How high should taxes be on the highest earners?

---

## The naive view

Raise the tax rate a little...

. . .

...and you should collect more tax revenue.

. . .

**But what might happen to the incomes of the highest earners?**

## Labor supply and taxes

As wages rise, people face a tradeoff:

- **Substitution effect:** Higher wages make leisure more expensive → work more
- **Income effect:** Higher wages mean you can afford more leisure → work less

. . .

Which dominates? It depends.

---

## A thought experiment

Suppose you're in charge of tax policy.

. . .

You raise the top tax rate from 40% to 50%.

. . .

**What happens to tax revenue?**

---

## The Laffer curve intuition

![](images/laffer-curve.svg){fig-align="center" width="70%"}

- At 0% tax: $0 revenue
- At 100% tax: $0 revenue (why work?)
- Somewhere in between: maximum revenue

---

## The key insight

> **Revenue = Tax Rate × Tax Base**

. . .

But the tax base is **endogenous**.

. . .

When rates rise, people may:

- Work fewer hours
- Shift income to other forms
- Move to other jurisdictions
- Engage in avoidance or evasion

---

## What does the evidence say?

Best empirical estimates suggest behavioral responses are **modest** in the short run.

. . .

Saez, Slemrod & Giertz (2012):

- Elasticity of taxable income ≈ 0.25
- "Behavioral responses are not negligible, but not as large as some claim"

::: {.notes}
Reference: Saez, Slemrod, and Giertz (2012). "The Elasticity of Taxable Income with Respect to Marginal Tax Rates." Journal of Economic Literature 50(1): 3-50.
:::

---

## What does this imply for optimal rates?

The revenue-maximizing tax rate formula:

> **t* = 1 / (1 + e)**

. . .

With e ≈ 0.25:

- t* = 1 / 1.25 = **80%**

. . .

Current US top rate (~37%) is well below this.

. . .

Higher rates would still raise revenue—though with efficiency costs.

---

## But some people are very responsive

**European soccer players** provide a striking example.

. . .

Kleven, Landais & Saez (2013) studied player mobility across 14 countries:

- Foreign players: elasticity ≈ **1.0** (highly responsive)
- Domestic players: elasticity ≈ 0.15 (less mobile)

. . .

Lower-tax countries attract the best talent.

## Spain's "Beckham Law"

In 2004, Spain cut tax rates for foreign workers from 43% to 24%.

---

## The lesson

When people **can** move, tax incentives matter a lot.

. . .

- Foreign players: highly mobile → big response
- Domestic players: less mobile → small response

. . .

The size of behavioral responses depends on **how easy it is to adjust**.

---

## An important clarification

> This is **not** an argument against taxes.

. . .

> It's an argument that **behavior matters**.

. . .

Revenue effects depend on behavioral responses—we need to measure them.

Strategic incentives

## Let's play a game

I'm going to collect a number from everyone in the class.

. . .

**Your job:** Guess what the class's average guess will be, **divided by two**.

. . .

- Pick any number from 0 to 100
- If the class average is 50, the winning guess is 25

---

---

## Discussion

- What were your individual incentives?
- What's the "best" response?
- What would perfectly rational players do?

---

## Let's play again

Now that you've thought about it...

. . .

[Play the game again]

Dynamic incentives

## The $20 bill auction

Here's a $20 bill. I'm going to auction it off.

. . .

**Rules:**

- Standard auction: highest bidder wins and pays their bid
- **But:** The second-highest bidder also pays their bid (and gets nothing)

. . .

We'll start at $1 and go up by $1 increments.

---

## Let's play

Who wants to bid $1?

---

## Discussion

Think about what happened:

. . .

- What were the **strategic** incentives at each point?

. . .

- How did **past bids** affect future incentives?

. . .

- What was the best approach from the start?

---

## The key lesson

> Each step was **locally rational**.

. . .

> The outcome was **globally terrible**.

. . .

You don't need irrational people to get insane outcomes—just the wrong rules.

---

## Let's play again

Knowing what you know now...

# Unintended consequences {background-color="#800000"}

When good intentions backfire

---

## The fundamental insight

As you can see, incentives are complicated.

. . .

The most fundamental reason policy is tricky:

> **People respond to the incentive itself, not your objective.**

---

## This isn't about bad intentions

- People aren't being malicious
- They're just playing the game you set up
- The way they play depends on each other and their history

---

## Goodhart's Law

> "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."

. . .

**Examples:**

- Teaching to the test
- Policing quotas
- Corporate KPIs
- Academic publishing (citations)

---

## Soviet nail factory (continued)

The planners wise up. They switch to a quota **by weight**.

. . .

**Now what happens?**

. . .

Factory switched to producing only huge nails.

. . .

No one ever made medium nails.

---

## Ban the box

Many jurisdictions "banned the box"—employers can't ask about criminal history on initial applications.

. . .

**Intended effect:** Help people with records get jobs.

. . .

**But think like an economist:** What might employers do instead?

---

## Ban the box (continued)

Employers, unable to screen on records, used **race as a proxy**.

. . .

Discrimination against Black applicants **increased**.

. . .

The policy backfired—for the very people it was meant to help.

---

## The evidence: Agan & Starr (2018)

Field experiment: ~15,000 fictitious job applications in NJ and NYC

. . .

**Before BTB** (at companies with "the box"):

- White callback rate: 11.1%
- Black callback rate: 10.9%
- Gap: **~7%** more callbacks for white applicants

. . .

**After BTB** (box removed):

- White callback rate: 14.8%
- Black callback rate: 10.3%
- Gap: **~43%** more callbacks for white applicants

## A policy question

You want students to learn more. You have money for incentives.

. . .

**Option A:** Pay students for good test scores

**Option B:** Pay students for reading books

. . .

**Which would you choose? Why?**

---

## The tradeoff

**Problem with paying for test scores (outputs):**

- Students might not know *how* to improve
- May encourage cheating
- May distort effort toward test-taking skills

. . .

**Paying for reading books (inputs):**

- Students know exactly what to do
- Harder to game
- Builds the skill you actually want

# Cognitive biases {background-color="#800000"}

When responses aren't what you'd predict

---

## People don't always respond "rationally"

A final complication: people don't always respond to incentives the way a simple model predicts.

. . .

Economists have documented many **cognitive** or **behavioral** biases.

---

## Inertia and defaults

When given choices, people tend to stick with the **default option**.

. . .

**Example:** 401(k) enrollment

- Opt-in default: ~50% participation
- Opt-out default: ~90% participation

. . .

Same options, very different outcomes.

::: {.notes}
Reference: Madrian & Shea (2001). "The Power of Suggestion: Inertia in 401(k) Participation and Savings Behavior." Quarterly Journal of Economics.
:::

---

## Is this really a "bias"?

Important question: Why might people rationally stick with the default?

. . .

- Information costs (the default might be a good recommendation)
- Time costs (switching takes effort)
- Uncertainty (maybe the default-setter knows something)

. . .

Important to separate **positive** (what people do) from **normative** (what they should do).

---

## Loss aversion

People feel losses more strongly than equivalent gains.

. . .

- Losing $100 feels worse than gaining $100 feels good
- Ratio is roughly 2:1

. . .

**Implications:**

- Framing matters (gains vs. losses)
- People may reject gambles that are favorable on average
- Status quo bias

# Wrapping up {background-color="#800000"}

---

## What we learned today

**Incentives determine:**

- What people try
- What they ignore
- What they distort
- How they adapt over time

---

## The bottom line

> **Policies don't operate on a fixed world—they change the world they operate on.**

. . .

Thinking like an economist means recognizing this when you design and evaluate policy.

---

## Looking ahead

Failing to account for behavioral responses can lead to disaster.

. . .

But doing so appropriately can be the key to managing everything—from your own life to the federal government.
