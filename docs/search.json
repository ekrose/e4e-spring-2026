Professors List and Rose will explore these big ideas without the math, making the beauty and power of economic thinking available to everyone.\nWe will discuss what it means to think like an economist, how you can use economic thinking to make the world a better place, and how economists think about today’s biggest issues, including what makes your rent get more expensive every year, why discrimination persists (and how to fix it), and how generative artificial intelligence will reshape the labor market."
